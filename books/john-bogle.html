  <h5>The book in 3 sentences:</h5>
  <p>The simplest and most efficient investment strategy is to buy and hold all of the nation's publicly held
    businesses at a very low cost. The more you move, the more you lose. The reason why investing in hedge
    funds and mutual funds has a lower return is because you lose money by paying fees and taxes.
  </p>
  <h5>My thoughts:</h5>
  <p> It was indeed a tiny book, but it could have been smaller. My take on this book is that if your
    investment cannot make over 10% return in the long-term (above 5 years), then you better just invest
    in index funds like S&P 500. Therefore, an index fund is your benchmark to evaluate whether you are
    doing a good job or you're just wasting your time. BUT!!! The most important thing that is missing
    in this book is the question of which decades you make your investment. 10 years from 1999 to 2008
    has shown the smallest growth rate on returns to S&P 500. The average total annual return for S&P 500
    including dividends was only 0.67%.

  <h5>Key lessons:</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>It’s hard to outperform the market; that is, S&P 500.</li>
    <li>Taxes and fees matter!!</li>
    <li>The more you move, the more you lose.</li>
    <li>Get rid of the helpers: always remember The Gotrocks Family parable.</li>
    <li>4 E’s by Warren Buffett: The greatest Enemies of the Equity investor are Expenses and Emotions.</li>
