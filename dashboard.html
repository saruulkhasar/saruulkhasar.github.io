        <h5>Overview:</h5>
        <p> I have read a couple of books on value investment recently.
          They led me to think that I need a comprehensive and systematic
          analysis framework to find promising companies. A book titled
          "The Warren Buffett Way" by Robert G. Hagstrom was a great starting
          point to dig deep into companies. So I have decided to take over
          this project to create a dashboard for key financial metrics measured
          from companies' financial statements. It's more accurate to compare
          companies among their peers. Therefore, I created separate dashboards
          for general merchandisers, tech companies, and biotech companies.
          This project consists of two parts. First, I wrote some Python
          code to prepare the datasets, namely the key financial metrics.
          Then, I extracted the datasets into CSV files and created the dashboards.
          <br>
          <h5>Tools and resources I used in this project:</h5>

          <ul>
            <li>Jupyter notebook</li>
            <li>Tableau</li>
            <li>Yahoo Finance</li>
            <li>Fortune 500</li>
          </ul>

            <h5>Step 2: Choose key metrics</h5>
            <p>
              I chose 6 metrics to measure companies' profitability, sustainability, indebtedness,
              and valuations. <br>
              <br>
              <b>1. Profit margin:</b> whether the company earns consistent profit and where it stands among the peers<br>
              <b>2. Current-ratio:</b> whether the company's liquid assets covers short-terms obligations <br>
              <b>3. Debt-to-equity:</b> whether the company is financed with debt more than equity <br>
              <b>4. P/E ratio:</b> investors' evaluation with respect to the company's earnings <br>
              <b>5. Return on equity:</b> whether the company is efficiently using it's equity <br>
              <b>6. The one dollar premise:</b> whether the company is using the retained earnings efficiently <br>

            <h5>Step 3: Export the metrics</h5>
            <p>
              I created two functions on Python. First, a function that imports the raw
              dataset and clean them to prepare for analysis. Second, a function that 
              calculates each indicator and export the outcome in comma separated file 
              format that is ready for Tableau dashboard. Then I wrote a loop to create 
              dataframe for all peer group indicators and created the dashboards. Creating 
              the dashboard is pretty straightforward given that we prepared the datasets.

            <h5>Conclusion: What do we get from the general merchandiser companies' dashboard? </h5>
            <p>
              1. In general Kohl's and Macy's have higher profit margin
              among their peers, but it seems to have declined in 2021. 
              Walmart and Target have pretty consistent profit margin around 25 to 30 percent.
              Costco has the lowest profit margin. Having low profit margin increases 
              the chances of risk to fail when there is certain economic shock happens. <br>
              <br>
              2. Kohl's has the best potential to pay-off their short-term 
              obligations. Failing to pay short-term obligations also put the 
              company in a risky position. <br>
              <br>
              3. Costco's most financing comes from equity. It is good. BJ's and Macy' 
              have higher debt in comparison to their peers. This may put them in a position
              where they have to waste lot of money on interest payments. <br>
              <br>
              4. Kohl's and Macy's p/e ratio information was not available for 2021. For other
              players investors seem to be more willing to pay higher price for Costco
              in comparison to its earnings per share. In other words, investors are more optimistic
              about Costco (I would probably be a little hesitent considering how low their
              profit margin is in comparison to its peers). <br>
              <br>
              5. Except for Kohl's and Macy's, most companies seem to be efficiently using the capital. <br>
              <br>
              6. The one-dollar-premise is a metrics I found from the Warren Buffett Way book. It 
              basically says for every dollar of retained earnings, the company should bring more than $1 
              value to its market capitalization in 5 years. <br>
